## Project Description

The main focus in this project is to model and syntetyse a data set of a choosen phenomenon using Python
The tasks are:
- To investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible
- Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook

For this project I chose to analyse the Private Health Insurance in Ireland in 2021.

Although Irelandâ€™s public health system offers health care at a significantly reduced rate, the long waitlists turn many people to private health insurance. The health insurance is perceived as a necessity not a luxury but there is lack of access to numerous public healt sevices in Ireland. For this reason people choose to purchase private healt insurance but the price consideration is a great barrier. Albeit private healt insurance offers much easier access healt services and hospitals research showes that people still expressed dissatisfaction with the customer service and level of cover on thier plan.

I will be researching the Incident of heatlh insurance in Ireland, Gender, Age, Social class, Region and Average number of children per policy.

We will be discussing each of these variables and their distribution. We will analise the relationship among them and will create a dataframe.

The project is created on a Jupyter notebook.

## System Requirement

To run the notebook on a local machine it is required to have Python installed.

It is reccomended to use Anaconda for Python installation.

## Running Jupyter notebook

- Go to PrivateHealth Ireland.ipynb in repository 
- Clone the repository to local machine 
- Open command line on the local machine or Cmder for Windows
- Navigate to the apropiate directory containg the cloned repository
- Type jupyter notebook to initiate the Jupyter web browser
- Open the file PrivateHealth Ireland.ipynb
